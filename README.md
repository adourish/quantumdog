Current Landscape
In classical computing, gates operate on bits and perform logical operations. Some of the most common ones include:
NOT Gate: This gate flips the state of a bit. 
If the input bit is 0, the output is 1, and vice versa.
AND Gate: This gate takes two bits as input. 
It returns 1 if both input bits are 1, otherwise, it returns 0.
OR Gate: This gate also takes two bits as input. 
It returns 1 if at least one of the input bits is 1, otherwise, it returns 0.
NAND Gate: This is the opposite of the AND gate. 
It returns 0 only if both input bits are 1, otherwise, it returns 1.
NOR Gate: This is the opposite of the OR gate. 
It returns 1 only if both input bits are 0, otherwise, it returns 0.
XOR (Exclusive OR) Gate: This gate returns 1 if the input bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.
XNOR (Exclusive NOR) Gate: This gate is the reverse of the XOR gate. 
It returns 0 if the input bits are different, and 1 if they are the same.
Just like in quantum computing, the symbol "⊗" in classical computing is used to denote the tensor product. However, in the context of classical computing, it is often used to denote the bitwise XOR operation, where each bit is processed independently.
Quantum Computing Gates
In quantum computing, several types of gates operate on qubits. Some of the most common ones include:
Pauli Gates: 
These include X, Y, and Z gates. The X gate is also known as a NOT gate and flips the state of a qubit. The Y and Z gates also flip the state but with a phase shift.
Hadamard Gate (H Gate): This gate creates superposition. 
It maps the basis state |0> to (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2) and |1> to (|0> - |1>) / sqrt(2). 
This means that a measurement will have equal probabilities to become 1 or 0, creating a 'quantum coin flip'.
Phase Gates: These include S and T gates. 
They leave the |0> state unchanged and add a phase of i (for the S gate) or exp(iπ/4) (for the T gate) to the |1> state.
Controlled Gates: The most famous one is the CNOT gate. 
It applies a NOT gate to the second qubit (target) if the first qubit (control) is |1>.
Rotation Gates: These gates rotate the state of qubits in the Bloch sphere. 
Examples include Rx, Ry, and Rz gates.
Swap Gates: These gates swap the states of two qubits.
The symbol "⊗" you asked is used to denote the tensor product, which is a way to combine two qubits into a joint state.
Qubits
In quantum computing, numbers are represented as states of qubits. A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information that can be in a superposition of states, representing both 0 and 1 at the same time.
To represent the number 42 in qubits, you first need to represent it in binary form. The number 42 in binary is '101010'. This means you would need six qubits to represent this number, where each qubit represents a binary digit (bit).
In a quantum circuit, each qubit is usually represented by a line. The state of the qubit (0 or 1) is represented by the type of gate applied to it. For example, an X-gate flips the state of a qubit from 0 to 1 and vice versa.
To represent the number 42 ('101010' in binary), you would initialize six qubits to the state 0 and then apply an X-gate to the 2nd, 4th and 6th qubits to flip their states to 1.
As a vector, a qubit in the state 0 is usually represented as [1, 0], and a qubit in the state one is represented as [0, 1]. Therefore, the number 42 can be represented as a tensor product of the six qubits: [0, 1] ⊗ [1, 0] ⊗ [0, 1] ⊗ [1, 0] ⊗ [0, 1] ⊗ [1, 0].
The symbol ⊗ in quantum circuits represents the tensor product, which is a way of combining vectors and matrices in a manner that preserves the essential information.
Why create a quantum circuit?
Creating a quantum circuit could be to solve complex computational problems more efficiently than classical computers. Quantum circuits can be useful for tasks such as factoring large numbers, searching large databases, or simulating quantum systems. These tasks are challenging for classical computers, especially as the size or complexity of the problem increases.
What are the challenges?
In the field of quantum computing, there are several challenges that researchers and scientists face. One of the main challenges is error correction, as quantum systems are highly susceptible to errors due to factors such as noise, decoherence, and environmental interference. Developing robust error correction techniques is crucial to ensure the reliability and accuracy of quantum computations.
Another significant challenge is maintaining the stability of quantum states. Quantum systems are inherently fragile and can easily lose coherence, leading to errors in calculations. Researchers are working on methods to extend the coherence times of quantum states, such as implementing error-correcting codes and using techniques like quantum error correction.
These challenges highlight the complexity and intricacies of quantum computing, requiring innovative solutions and advancements in technology to overcome them and realize the full potential of quantum computing.

What types of quantum devices are available
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ)
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits refer to the current generation of quantum devices, which exist at a size and quality between classical devices and error-corrected quantum computers. 
They're labelled as "noisy" due to the quantum errors present in their operation and "intermediate scale" to indicate their moderate quantum bit (qubit) count, typically between 50 and a few hundred qubits.
Creating quantum circuits for NISQ devices is one of the use cases of quantum computing. However, as the "noisy" label implies, these circuits are susceptible to errors, which can lead to inaccurate results.
Programming languages like Qiskit (from IBM), Cirq (from Google), and PyQuil (from Rigetti) can be used to create these quantum circuits. Each of these languages has its pros and cons. 
For instance, Qiskit is widely used and has a strong community, but it may have a steep learning curve for those new to quantum computing. Cirq, on the other hand, offers a very Pythonic interface and is easy to integrate with other Google services, but it is less mature and less widely used than Qiskit. PyQuil is also pythonic and provides easy access to quantum hardware, but its community is smaller compared to Qiskit.
The efficiency of quantum circuits on NISQ devices is highly dependent on the specific problem, the algorithm used, and the noise in the system. It's not necessarily related to the number of parameters in a function. However, creating quantum circuits can potentially provide speedups for some specific tasks where many parameters are involved, such as quantum chemistry simulations and some machine learning algorithms.

Example of a dictionary quantum circuit
This circuit is a simple quantum circuit that consists of three qubits. It starts with a Hadamard gate (H) applied to the first qubit, putting it into a superposition of states. The control-not gates (@) are then applied, with the first qubit as the control and the second and third qubits as targets. This entangles the three qubits, linking their states together.
The final step is the measurement (M), which is performed on all three qubits. The 'result' string is a label for the measurement results. 
The outcome of this measurement will be a string of three bits. Due to the entanglement, the second and third qubits will always give the same measurement result. The first qubit will be in a state that is correlated with the state of the other two. 
In essence, this circuit creates and measures an entangled state of three qubits.
